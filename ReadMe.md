# Calculator

![Calculator Art](art.py)

Welcome to the Calculator program! This program allows you to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It provides a user-friendly interface and features the ASCII art logo for visual appeal.

## Features

- Addition: Add two numbers together.
- Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.
- Multiplication: Multiply two numbers together.
- Division: Divide one number by another.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the `art.py` and `main.py` files in the same directory as the program.
3. Run the `main.py` file using a Python interpreter: `python main.py`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations using the calculator.

## Main Learnings

During the development of this calculator program, I have learned the following key concepts:

- How functions that provide outputs are useful in complex programs.
- The ability to use the output from one function call as input for the next function call.
- Reusability of functions in different parts of the code, reducing repetition and improving flexibility.

These learnings showcase my understanding of using functions to modularize code and enhance its efficiency and readability.

Feel free to explore the `main.py` and `art.py` files for further details.

Enjoy using the Calculator program!
